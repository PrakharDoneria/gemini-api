### üîÑ Updated Sample Request (POST)

You can now include an optional `system_instruction` field to customize the AI's behavior.

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "input": "Create a description for a new music album inspired by nature.",
    "system_instruction": "You are a poetic music critic AI that writes beautiful descriptions of ambient albums."
}'
```

If you omit `system_instruction`, the default will be used:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input": "Create a description for a new music album inspired by nature."}'
```

You can also use tools like **Postman**, **Insomnia**, or any HTTP client with the same structure.
